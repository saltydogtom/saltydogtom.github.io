			<h1> About Kendal</h1>
			<h2>Residents Handbook </h2>
	
      			This Handbook has been prepared for you. It is hoped that it will be helpful when you first join the Kendal Community and that it will continue to be one of 
				  your best sources of information during your years at Kendal.
				Ever since the opening of Kendal at Lexington in July 2000, keeping residents informed has been an important goal of both the Residents Council and the 
				Kendal Staff. As policies and procedures are developed and as they are changed, you will need to be informed. For this reason, the Handbook has been 
				designed as a work-in-progress. It will be up to you to keep your Handbook up to date by inserting revisions and additions when they are provided.
      			It is hoped that this Handbook will enable residents to share a common understanding about the customs and practices that guide and enhance our life in 
				  this community. If you have questions or concerns about the information that is included, or if you need additional information, do not hesitate to contact the 
				  members of the Residents Council or the Kendal Staff.

						<li><h4>History of the Property</h4>
							<div class="small-text" >
								Sunnyside House, the large three-story farmhouse on the Kendal property, which dates back to the late 1700s, was expanded over the years, 
								and serves today as the community's guest house.  The house, along with 85 acres, was a gift to Kendal from Isabel and Fred Bartenstein for 
								the purpose of creating a retirement facility.  Sunnyside House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
							</div>
							<div class="small-text">
       
								After having belonged to many owners, the house and farm were purchased in 1926 by Colonel James A. Anderson, his wife, and her two sisters, 
								the Misses Helen and Ella Webster.  Colonel Anderson was a VMI professor and dean and later was state highway commissioner.  The Webster 'girls' 
								served as secretaries to the president and treasurer of Washington and Lee University.   In addition to their professional activities, these 
								owners operated a highly regarded dairy farm on the property for 30 years.  Upon the death in 1985 of the last survivor, Miss Ella Webster, the 
								four grown children of the Andersons inherited the property.  By 1995, Isabel Bartenstein of New Jersey had bought out the interests of her 
								siblings.  She and her husband Fred later worked with Lexington and Rockbridge County residents to create the retirement community that is now 
								Kendal at Lexington.
							</div>
							<div class="small-text">

								The capacious old house stood for some time in serious need of repair. But, thanks to Fred Bartenstein's extraordinary generosity and great 
								desire to honor Isabel and the Anderson family, funds became available to stabilize the foundations, install new bathrooms, add wiring, plumbing, 
								and heating and cooling systems, install an elevator, and provide new wall and floor treatment.  Following this extensive renovation, a resident 
								committee furnished the house with gifts from some 100 residents and friends.  An official dedication of Sunnyside House was held in October of 
								2006.  Subsequently, the grounds were re-landscaped and an old boxwood 'secret garden' restored.
							</div>
							<div class="small-text">

								Today Kendal residents may reserve for their guests any of the five large bedrooms on the second floor (two of which are handicapped accessible), 
								as well as  sign up to use rooms on the first floor  for meetings, classes, dinners, and receptions. These high-ceilinged rooms, each with at 
								least one fireplace, include a large dining room which can seat 12, a well-equipped catering kitchen, a gracious parlor, a smaller library/game 
								room, and a large meeting or Great Room seating 40 persons.  The woodworking shop, a 'train room' for local model train buffs, and a room used 
								by resident artists are located in the basement..
							</div>
							<div class="small-text">

								A short drive from Sycamore Lane brings guests directly to a parking area for cars on the southwest side of Sunnyside House and provides basement 
								access to the building and to the elevator.
